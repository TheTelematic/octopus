# octopus
My end-of-degree project, a system based on microservices. Running microservers and launch new of them when the system is colapsed.


Notes:
    Be carefull, in the file CMakeLists.txt must be enabled the drivers!

    To launch with VMware Player and vga the drivers are:
      vmxnet3 vga_output
